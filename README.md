# Chat Screen UI

The chat screen features a simple user interface with a clean and intuitive design. It consists of a conversation window where messages are displayed in a threaded manner, allowing users to easily follow the conversation. The UI includes input fields for typing messages and clear display of sender names and timestamps for each message.
